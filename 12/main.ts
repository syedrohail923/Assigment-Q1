//Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

let transportationList = ["Hayabusa", "Dodge Challenger", "Mustang 1969", "Skyline GT-R34"]
for (let i = 0; i < transportationList.length; i++){
    console.log("I would like to own a " + transportationList [i] + ".");
}
