//Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicians_name = ["Jaadu", "Bhola", "Venom"];
function make_great(names) {
    for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
        names[i] = "the Great " + names[i];
    }
}
function show_magicians(names) {
    for (var i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
        console.log(names[i]);
    }
}
make_great(magicians_name);
show_magicians(magicians_name);
