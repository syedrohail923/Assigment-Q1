// Animals: Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic. Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a for loop to print out the name of each animal. • Modify your program to print a statement about each animal, such as A dog would make a great pet. • Add a line at the end of your program stating what these animals have in common. You could print a sentence such as Any of these animals would make a great pet!
var animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit'];
for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
    console.log(animals[i]);
}
for (var i = 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
    switch (animals[i]) {
        case "dog":
            console.log("A dog would make a great pet.");
            break;
        case "cat":
            console.log("A cat would make a great companion.");
            break;
        case "rabbit":
            console.log("A rabbit would make a great addition to a family.");
            break;
        default:
            console.log("Unknown animal.");
    }
}
console.log("These animals are all mammals");
console.log('Any of these animals would make a great pet!');
